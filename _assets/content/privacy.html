<h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</h2>
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to include a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and the individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. Learn more about CalOPPA at the Consumer Federation of California’s website. 
In compliance with CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
<ul>
  <li>Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>
  <li>We have created a privacy policy and a link to it on our home page, or at a minimum, on the first significant page upon entering our website. </li>
  <li>Our privacy policy link includes the word “privacy” and can easily be found on the page specified above. </li>
  <li>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy page. </li>
  <li>Users are able to change their personal information by calling us. </li>

<h3>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</h3>
Any website, blog, or app provided by Brian Hodgkiss Injury Lawyers may allow third party behavioral tracking. 
<h2>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</h2>
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) outlines what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online by regulating the collection of personal information of children under the age of 13. This website does not specifically market to children under age 13.
<h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>
The Fair Information Practice Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States. In order to be in line with Fair Information Practice Principles, we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
<ul>
  <li>We will notify affected users via email within 7 business days. </li>
  <li>We will notify affected users via phone call within 7 business days. </li>
</ul>
We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

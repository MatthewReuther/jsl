<h2>What Makes a Drug Defective?</h2>

Although approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) make medications appear safe, this isn’t always true. Defects can be discovered months or years after a drug is initially approved, causing severe complications to the people who take them.

Drug injuries can result from a variety of factors, including:
<ul>
 	<li>Defective or negligent manufacturing processes</li>
 	<li>Inadequate warning labels</li>
 	<li>Harmful interactions with other drugs</li>
</ul>

When pharmaceutical companies release drugs that cause harm to innocent people, our Wisconsin legal team is prepared to hold them accountable. Drug manufacturers are armed with strong legal teams, but you don’t have to face them alone. Get a Wisconsin drug injury lawyer on your side.

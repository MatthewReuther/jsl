<h2>Common Causes of Pedestrian Injuries in Wisconsin </h2>
When you choose us to handle your injury claim, you can count on us to thoroughly investigate your accident to determine what happened. Although there are laws in place in Wisconsin to protect pedestrians, not all motorists abide by them. Some of the most common scenarios that result in pedestrian injuries include:
<dl>
  <dt>Failure to Yield</dt>
  <dd>Pedestrians always have the right of way, even at unmarked crosswalks. Drivers should be on the lookout for pedestrians and yield accordingly.</dd>
  <dt>Distracted Drivers</dt>
  <dd>Anything that takes a driver’s focus off the road is considered a distraction. Talking with other passengers, texting, and even daydreaming can result in life-threatening mistakes. </dd>
  <dt>Failure to Obey Traffic Laws</dt>
  <dd>When drivers or other motorists don’t follow speed limits, traffic lights, or other rules of the road, their carelessness puts pedestrians at risk.</dd> 
  <dt>Driving Under the Influence</dt>
  <dd>Alcohol, drugs, and other substances can impair judgement, vision, and reaction time, but those skills are necessary when assessing oncoming traffic—including those on foot. </dd>

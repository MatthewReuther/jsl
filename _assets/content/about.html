[H1] About Us
After an accident or injury, you’re probably dealing with medical bills, pain and suffering, and time away from work. You may also be concerned about how you will provide for yourself and your family. Insurance companies are often quick to offer settlements to injury victims in your situation—but these offers usually don’t come close to covering all injury-related expenses.
At Brian Hodgkiss Injury Lawyers, we don’t think you should have to settle for anything less than what your claim deserves. We want to revolutionize the way personal injury law firms work in Wisconsin. Our team knows that helping you get the best results for your claim requires getting to know you and your individual situation on a personal level—something the insurance company and many bigger law firms just won’t take the time to do. 

If you were injured in Wisconsin, Bank on Brian! When you choose our team to handle your case, you join a team of dedicated legal professionals, and it’s our goal to help you get maximum results. Contact our 24/7 team anytime to get started with a free case review.

<h3>Attorney</h3>

Brian P. Hodgkiss is driven by his desire to affect change—not merely be affected by it—and for the past two decades, he’s done exactly this for injury victims throughout Wisconsin. As a personal injury lawyer, Brian strives not only to empower his clients, but also to empower his community through safety initiatives and accountability. 

Brian’s commitment to client service and perseverance in the courtroom are evidenced by the results he obtains for his clients. One of his proudest legal accomplishments was winning a case deemed unwinnable by the opposing counsel. Additionally, early on in his career, Brian pursued a case that had been dropped by another lawyer, but he believed this client deserved a fair trial. His instincts proved true. Brian found three additional witnesses that the previous attorney had overlooked, and he ultimately obtained a verdict in excess of one million dollars. 

One of his favorite parts of the job is giving clients respite and peace of mind throughout the legal process so they can focus on their health and well-being. He finds a great deal of satisfaction in getting to know his clients, telling them how he can help, and delivering on his commitments. 

When he’s not working, Brian’s greatest hobby is spending time with his family. He enjoys cheering on his two daughters at their sporting events and piano recitals. In his spare time, Brian plays guitar and drums in a couple different bands, and he loves playing golf, water skiing, and crying over the Packers.

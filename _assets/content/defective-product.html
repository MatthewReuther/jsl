<h2>What Makes a Product Defective?</h2>
Despite safety regulations, dangerous products can still make it onto shelves and into our homes for various reasons, including:
<ul>
<li>Defective manufacturing processes – Flawed manufacturing processes and improper testing can lead to product defects that may go unaddressed. </li>
<li>Poor or faulty product design – Low-quality materials and missing safety features can make a product dangerous for users—even if it is tested properly. </li>
<li>Failure to provide proper warnings – Product labels are supposed to provide adequate instructions for use and warn consumers of potential safety risks, but manufacturers aren’t always transparent about known hazards.</li>
</ul>

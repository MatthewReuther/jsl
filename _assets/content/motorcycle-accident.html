<h2>Wisconsin Motorcyclists Face Unique Injury Hazards</h2>
Insurance companies often place unfair blame on motorcyclists, but we know that most motorcyclists are committed to safe riding practices. Even the most cautious riders can be involved in crashes due to hazards such as: 
<ul>
  <li>Distracted drivers</li>
  <li>Loose gravel or pavement</li>
  <li>Reduced visibility</li>
  <li>Motorcycle defects</li>
</ul>
Although motorcyclists deserve the same respect as other motorists on the road, not all drivers look out for them. This carelessness can lead to accidents involving: 
<ul>
  <li>Failure to yield to motorcyclists at intersections</li>
  <li>Failure to look for motorcyclists while entering roadways</li>
  <li>Failure to look for motorcyclists when changing lanes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Causes of Truck Accidents in Wisconsin</h2>
Building a strong truck accident claim requires proving who or what was at fault for the crash. Some of the most common truck accident causes include: 
<li>Drowsy or distracted driving</li>
<li>Infrequent or improper truck maintenance</li>
<li>Driver error</li>
<li>Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) violations</li>
